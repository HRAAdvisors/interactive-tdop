      'Broadband is always-on, high-speed internet service. The Federal Communication Commission (FCC) – the agency that oversees many policies and regulations that have to do with the internet – defines high-speed internet as service delivering at least 25 megabits per second (Mbps) for downloads and 3 Mbps for uploads. Proposed new definitions of “broadband service” from the FCC go further: 100 Mbps download and 20 Mbps upload. For the purposes of this plan and its metrics on internet adoption, we are using the Census Bureau’s American Community Survey definition of high-speed internet as service provided via fiberoptic, cable, and DSL systems.
