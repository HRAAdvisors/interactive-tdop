Therefore, the BDO will promote activities to support Texans in signing up for and using the internet as it is made available across the state – advancing multiple statewide priorities and benefitting Texans and internet service providers through an expanded customer base. The BDO will invest in additional programs that provide the tools and resources people need to engage in civic, educational, health and other online activities.',

        Broadband adoption, digital literacy, device access and many other aspects of digital
        opportunity need local solutions. Trust, safety, and confidence are very important to this
        process, therefore leaders and local partner organizations will be from the communities they
        serve.
