          More and more each day, our lives depend on using the internet. Once a luxury, the
          internet has now become{' '}

            a necessity for access to health, education, employment, and many services.

          <strong>not all Texas residents experience the same kind of digital opportunity.</strong>{' '}
          Some Texans thrive in the digital world, while others struggle just to find an internet

        <p>
          In 2023, the Texas Broadband Development Office (BDO) brought together people and
          communities from across the state to ask about the barriers and challenges that Texans
          face when they try to get online and use the internet.{' '}
          <strong>
            They also asked about who is already working to support the digital needs of Texas
            communities, and how theyâ€™re doing it.

          <strong>Based on what the BDO heard from you,</strong> they wrote the Texas Digital
          Opportunity Plan or TDOP, which shares a vision for digital opportunity in Texas in which
