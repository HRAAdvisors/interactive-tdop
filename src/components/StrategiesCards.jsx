        description: 'The BDO recognizes that building the physical infrastructure to connect unserved and underserved Texans to broadband is only one component of expanding broadband adoption. Therefore, the BDO will promote activities to support Texans in signing up for and using internet as it is made available across the state – benefitting Texans, multiple statewide priorities and the telecom industry through an expanded customer base.',

        description: 'Broadband adoption, digital literacy, device access and many other aspects of digital opportunity require locally based, culturally appropriate efforts. Leadership should come from the same communities that these efforts aim to serve; trust, safety and confidence are essential components of digital opportunity. The BDO will allocate a portion of its Capacity Grant to create a digital opportunity grant program, comparable to the BOOT program for broadband infrastructure, to fund local initiatives addressing the gaps in digital opportunity for covered populations and underserved regions.',

        description: 'The BDO envisions this plan as a living document, to be updated through continued research. The BDO has gathered extensive baseline data, established relationships with stakeholders and residents and gained a firm understanding of the needs and barriers of Texans statewide – regionally and among covered populations. The BDO aims to build upon this foundation and make this plan a sustainable resource to support digital opportunity statewide by measuring progress and continuing to collect critical data to enable the state and its local partners to advance and iterate impactful programs.',
