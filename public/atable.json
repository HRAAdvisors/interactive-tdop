                "Asset Description": "Combined Arms (CAX) has solved for the fragmented social service ecosystem by building a secure, scalable, and user-friendly technology platform for resource connection, and bi-lateral inter-agency referrals, with enforced, network-wide accountability. We have partnered with veteran non-profit hubs, states, and federal entities, deploying our platform to efficiently and expeditiously connect and serve nonprofits, government agencies, and military and veteran families.\n\nCAX was awarded support from the Texas Workforce Commission to build a network that would make Texas the first interconnected state for veterans and their families. Launched in April 2020, Combined Arms has grown the Texas Veterans Network (TVN) to include more than 250 best-in-class, vetted veteran-serving organizations, and state agencies that collectively offer more than 1,030 resources for transitioning service members, veterans, and their families. In just 36 months, the Texas Veterans Network team has connected more than 40,013 unique veterans to 68, 239 social service resources.\n\nIn 2022, the TVN created $265,303,249 economic impact to the state.\n\nHealthcare: Healthcare expenses for uninsured individuals cost taxpayers an average $1,467 per person per year. 96 unique veterans were connected to resources to support enrollment in VHA benefits, yielding an estimated $140,000 in annual taxpayer savings.\nHomelessness: According to the VA, the mid-range net cost savings estimate from housing a homeless veteran is $45,000. 991 unique veterans were connected to homelessness assistance resources and services, yielding a $111,487,500 reduction in taxpayer, federal, and state expenses.\nBenefits: The average monthly VA benefits compensation payment is $1,866. 727 unique veterans were connected to benefits assistance resources and services, yielding $16,284,800 economic impact to the state of Texas.\n\nTrends over the last 36 months for the Texas Veterans Network show the following:\n\nMore than 2,953 veterans were connected to the Texas Veterans Commission (TVC) Benefits, Employment, HealthCare Enrollment, Women's Benefits, and Education Counseling programs\n\n52% of those that requested financial assistance were also connected to financial workshops or career services\n\n49% of clients that requested food assistance were also connected to financial assistance\n\n1,046 transitioning service members and veterans were connected to best-in-class mental and brain health resources by way of the Veteran Wellness Alliance\n\n27% of those that requested mental health also requested physical fitness and/or social connectivity\n\n433% YoY increase in # of veterans who self-identify as Black in 2022 v 2021\n\n408% YoY increase in # of veterans who self-identify as Hispanic in 2022 v 2021\n\nCombined Arms has solved for the fragmented social service ecosystem by delivering a one-stop shop, single point of entry to match social service resources to anything a veteran or military family member could ever need. With the Texas Veterans Network, over 40,000 individual clients have had their quality of life increased by connecting to resources available in our network and on our proprietary technology platform.\n\nIn 2022, Combined Arms conducted a case study to test if veterans' well-being increased after being connected to resources. The study reviewed a population sample of 382 individual client WHO-5 scores, maintaining a 95% Confidence Level of the data. The measures denote an average increase of WHO-5 Well-Being scores by 1.92 out of a 25-point scale, equating to a 7.68 point increase in the cumulative WHO-5 Well-Being evaluation.\n\nThe statistics from the study show that the Combined Arms Model effectively increases the WHO-5 Scores of clients when using the system to connect to resources and solve their problems. Clients are leaving with a self-reported, unbiased increase in their well-being. Higher well-being is linked to many positive outcomes regarding physical health and longevity and better individual performance at work, and higher life satisfaction has been linked to better national economic performance. Ultimately, increasing veteran well-being is an impact measurement that validates veterans will live healthier, happier, longer, more fulfilled, and more productive lives.",

                "Asset Description": "The library offers free computer usage and wifi access. We are one of the few places in town where people can print from their phones. We loan hotspots, chromebooks, and laptops free of charge. We also offer one-on-one assistance as well as computer classes.\n\nOur staff spends a lot of time helping customers with job applications, accessing online forms, etc. With smart phones, we don't get as many people wanting to use computers as we once did or requests for computer classes. Many things can be done with smart phones. The difficulty comes when people need to print or don't really know how to use their smart phones to access things beyond social media or email. The skills to use a smart phone don't transfer to a computer. This is where one-on-one assistance is needed. There are also people that have been referred to online sites, but have no idea how to use a computer. For extensive help, we request that they bring someone to help them. However, many times these people might be socially isolated or their social network also lacks the necessary computer skills.\n\nThere is also an issue of privacy. Libraries protect reference and research inquiries of customers. Having library staff help with forms can sometimes be problematic as some of these forms require social security numbers or other identifying information. Our staff requires the customer to type in this sort of information. For some people this is problematic--- maybe they have a disability or tremors that make it difficult to type or sometimes they don't know their information. Some people are too trusting of other people and will sometimes ask people around them to help complete forms. Navigators or social workers in libraries would be very helpful. Even though we offer computer classes, when someone needs assistance, they need it immediately. They might be in crisis mode at that time. Not all libraries have the ability to provide one-on-one assistance. We are fortunate that we have several Spanish-speaking staff members, but we are limited in our ability to help our Somalian and Burmese population.\n\nThe hotspots are great. We have about 20 and they are almost always checked out. They are a band-aid approach to Internet access, but sometimes they are better than nothing. Not everyone has good cell connection at their home.\n\nLibraries also provide wifi access. At our library, the wifi is an open network. We see people here daily doing school work, working remotely, doing job interviews, etc., on their own devices, but accessing our free wifi. It is vital.\n\nAnother service that's dependent on broadband is the ability to scan and email copies. We do this from our public copier (which is an accreditation requirement from Texas State Library and Archives Commission). We do not track how many people use this service, but we help people at least once per day scan and email documents. We do this at no charge and we actually show people how to do it.\n\nThe one-on-one assistance that many libraries provide is important. Some of these services (wifi, copying, computer access) might be obtained at an Internet cafe, copy store, or restaurant, but having someone help you is not as common in non-library settings.\n\nOur library also offers computer classes to businesses.\n\nFor libraries, the best support we can get is funding for hotspots and Internet accessible devices and personnel to provide one-on-one assistance.",

The services and programs offered by CCSCA, Inc., keep our seniors active and young at heart.",

Each individual enrolled in our Digital Device Loan Program or Digital Skills for Families Program will receive their own digital backpack to use. Upon completion and graduation from the training program, participants may be eligible for the Learn it, Earn It, Keep It program, where they can keep the devices loaned to them for their personal use upon graduating from their perspective program.\n\nThe Digital Skills for Families Program aims to turn digital skills training into a family affair! DISD high school students and their legal guardians can enroll in in the program as a pair (or more!) and take digital skills training with us. Classes focus on basic computer skills, resum\u00c3\u00a9 building, job searching and applications, Google Suite Training, online learning modules, and financial literacy.  All participants are provided with one-on-one case management and a digital backpack with tech accessories and stationery. Participants are additionally supported through our Device Loan Program, the 10-Step Roadmap to Self-Sufficiency, and a financial literacy session hosted by a partner bank.  ",

One barrier to this is that our great state is larger than most and our children are more spread out than others. Community volunteers can be hard to come by for each program so providing more digital resources would enhance current and future access to programs and allow more children to enter into 4H.",

We then introduced our \"Job Fair in a Bag\" program. This was implemented to help members of our community get the resources needed in acquiring a job post-pandemic. The kits come with a laptop, hotspot device and additional resources(resume writing, Texas Workforce Commission information, etc.) to make the job searching process a smooth and hopefully successful one.",

We have a robust digital navigator program through the National Digital Navigator Corps, organized by NDIA. We offer one-on-one help as well as group training. The Pottsboro Library is a demonstration site for assistive technology. We distribute $20,000 of new devices each year to the community. Through a variety of innovative models, we provide connectivity to people who live in Grayson County. We convened the stakeholders in our community to form the Grayson County Broadband Coalition. I work with broadband mapping consultants and researchers to gather digital inclusion data. I am a founding member of a Collaborative Institute of Rural Communities and Librarianship, recently convened at the University of Texas School of Information. Through this organization, we'll be gathering data and establishing best practices for libraries worldwide. I can't think of anything we don't do that is related to digital equity. It is our passion.",

Many of our economically challenged students and rural families do not have access to broadband access.  Some areas such as Fresno do not have Internet carriers available.  Even the current discount from Comcast is a challenge for our families to pay.  With the current budget challenges, our school district could not afford to increase our Internet bandwidth to accommodate the vast increase in bandwidth demands.  Even though, we recently got a grant from the federal government to provide 1:1 laptops to our student in secondary schools, we do not have support staff to support these additional laptops.  Bottom line, we need our state to increase the allotment for each student with the large state budget surplus.",

Digital opportunity in public and affordable housing means very low-income residents can access education, workforce training and jobs, health and wellness options and greater quality-of-life. When housing residents adopt digital tools, public and affordable housers can use digital tools to improve service availability and decrease operating cost. Digitally-enabled services accessed by public and affordable housing residents across the services continuum could decrease system-wide service cost, duplication of effort and could increase the rate of service uptake and resident opportunity program completion.\n\nBroadband and digital literacy funds can be effectively deployed to drive opportunity, including economic development, workforce development and health and wellness. Broadband is a proven super social determinant of health. We have seen great improvements in Emergency Response & Resilience in communities that have high-speed broadband, devices and digital literacy programming, especially when some of that programming is provided by neighbors who serve as HACA Digital Ambassadors.\n\nAdoption is greatest (and therefore time-to-money for the provider is fastest) when three digital enablement tools are deployed simultaneously: internet service, devices and digital literacy.\n\nThe human connection drives technology adoption. Awardees and funded entities should be required to hire residents (or provide HUD-approved volunteer service stipends which don't count as income toward rent) to do the work: identify requirements, design the solution, deploy the solution to neighbors and evaluate the result.\n\nPublic private philanthropic partnerships are the key to long-term success. The \"trust infrastructure\" required to ensure broadband adoption for economic and social benefit relies on the intersecting interests of those entity types.  When each partner has \"skin in the game,\" there is greater service alignment, more impactful outcomes and greater sustainability.\n",
